A change log of released and upcoming features can be found here: https://laithdevelopment.github.io/rubydefinitivemcupdate/

There are not many changes/additions yet, but there is plenty of updates yet to come.

How to launch the mod on MultiMC:

Create a new instance, check the alphas tab on the right.
Scroll down until you see RD-161348
Click it and then click "Ok"
Right click on the instance you just added
Then click "Edit Instance"
Look on the right where it says "Replace Jar"
Click that, and open up the RubyDefinitive file.

You can also run the mod without MultiMC using this method:

Put all of the required dependencies in the same folder as RubyDefinitive (this includes lwjgl.jar, lwjgl_util.jar, jinput.jar and all of the dlls (natives))
Next, open command prompt in the directory and execute this command: "java.exe -cp lwjgl.jar;lwjgl_util.jar;jinput.jar;RubyDefinitive.jar com.mojang.minecraft.RubyDung"
or you can create a .bat file containing the same command in the main directory
